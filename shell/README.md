### Shell

**What is a Computer?**  
A computer is essentially an adding machine, connected to a clock that ticks and performs a simple calculation a couple billion times a second, querying and saving data to a storage device (a hard drive or memory) as it runs.  [Learn more...](http://www.simplecpu.com/)  
  
**Operating System**  
The operating system is the program (a program is a series of instructions) that runs when you turn on your computer.  
What does the operating system do?  

-   handles inputs (keyboard, mouse, camera, network connections)
-   handles outputs (monitor, speakers, network connections)
-   manages shared access to computing resources and memory
-   reads and writes data to the file system on behalf of simultaneously running applications (web browser, code editor, text document, music player, etc)

What are examples of operating systems? Which one are you using right now?  
  

#### **User Interfaces**

Computers can receive user input through either a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). We are more familiar with the GUI.  
  

#### The Graphical User Interface (GUI)

In a graphical user interface, the mouse is used to interact with skeuomorphic icons to open files and applications, navigate the file system, or change settings as well as input text through the keyboard which is passed to the currently "focused" element (such as the body of an email or the URL bar in your browser). Basically, it helps you make changes and look around your computer.  
  

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)

In a command line interface (also known as "console", "Terminal", or "shell"), the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action. The computer will display the results of the operation by writing text to the screen.  
Graphical user interfaces (GUI) are easier to use but command lines allow programmers more powerful and detailed control over their computers.  
**Today, we will learn how to use the CLI.**  
  

#### A Detour Through the CLI

How do we get to our computer's CLI?  
On a Mac, the CLI is a program called **Terminal**. On a Windows, the CLI is a program called **Command Prompt**. Through Terminal or Command Prompt, we'll be able to access our shell, a command interpreter. The most common shell, and the one used in our Macs, is called bash. The Terminal or Command Prompt is just a tool we use to view the shell, akin to using a browser to view the web.
