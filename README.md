# Git

Before getting started, make sure that you're familiar with the  [Shell.](/shell)

  

Like most skilled professions, it's difficult to jump into software engineering without becoming familiar with the tools you'll use to get the job done. The most crucial of these tools is Git, an industry-standard version control system and collaboration tool.  
  
At this point, you might be wondering: What is version control, anyway?  
  
A version control system is a tool for tracking changes to your code. Think of it as the world's longest undo history: If you've ever broken a piece of your code and been unable to figure out how to go back to a working state, version control is what you've been looking for. Git is built from the ground up to help you avoid losing code, and also has powerful collaboration facilities built right in to help you collaborate with others on the same codebase.  
  
Understanding how to use Git is critical not only to your success as a student, but as a software engineer.
